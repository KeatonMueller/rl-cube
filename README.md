# rl-cube
This is my attempt to use reinforcement learning to solve a Rubik's Cube without the aid of human knowledge.

I'm working on this project as a part of CPSC 674: Advanced Computational Intelligence for Games.

Many of the ideas I will draw upon and try to recreate come from these two papers:

- https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07470

- https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0070-z

## How it Works
### Autodidactic Iteration
One method this project uses is a technique introduced by Stephen McAleer called Autodidactic Iteration.

First a joint policy and value network is trained via reinforcement learning.
Training examples are generated by randomly scrambling Rubik's Cubes, and
their labels are created using the network being trained. After a period of time,
new training samples are generated and labelled with the updated parameters.
This process is repeated several times.

Once the policy and value network is trained, it is used to guide a Monte-Carlo
Tree Search to go from the scrambled to the solved state.

### Approximate Value Iteration
Another method is introduced by Forest Agostinelli called Approximate Value Iteration.

First a Cost-to-Go function is trained via reinforcement leraning.
Afterwards, it is used as a heuristic for A* Search to try to solve the cube.

## How to Use It
You need Python 3 and PyTorch to run this project. It is also recommend you use a CUDA enabled machine.

If you want to download any models with the `.ckpt` file extension (this doesn't apply to `.lckpt`),
you'll need [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/ "Git LFS") installed.

To see a list of options for this project, clone this repo and run


`python3 driver.py --help`

To type in scrambles for a pre-trained model to attempt to solve, run something like

`python3 driver.py --load model_1300.lckpt --solve`

Note that as of this time, the model is still in the process of being
trained. The time it takes to find solutions will vary depending on
machine it's run on, and it is not yet able to handle scrambles of
arbitrary length. The current model performs reasonably well on scrambles
up to a length of 6.
