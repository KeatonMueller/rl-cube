# rl-cube
This is my attempt to use reinforcement learning to solve a Rubik's Cube without the aid of human knowledge.

I'm working on this project as a part of CPSC 674: Advanced Computational Intelligence for Games.

Many of the ideas I will draw upon and try to recreate come from this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07470
