Results using naive tests

	- with SGD optimizer and lr = 0.1, solved 12 out of 12 1-move scrambles
		- periods = 5, epochs = 5, batch size = 1
		- NUM_SCRAMBLES = 50, SCRAMBLE_LENGTH = 1

	- with SGD optimizer and lr = 0.01, solved 122 out of 144 2-move scrambles
		- periods = 10, epochs = 50, batch size = 1
		- NUM_SCRAMBLES = 50, SCRAMBLE_LENGTH = 2

Results using mcts tests
	- with SGD optimizer and lr = 0.1, solved 122 out of 144 2-move scrambles
		- periods = 5, epochs = 5, batch size = 1
		- NUM_SCRAMBLES = 50, SCRAMBLE_LENGTH = 1 ** but only trained it on one move scrambles!
To-Do:
	- add batching
	- add cuda utilization
	- add BFS following MCTS to shorten solution lengths
