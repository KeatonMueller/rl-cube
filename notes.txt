Results using just policy, no MCTS yet

	- with SGD optimizer and lr = 0.1, solved 12 out of 12 1-move scrambles
		- periods = 5, epochs = 5, batch size = 1

	- with SGD optimizer and lr = 0.01, solved 113 out of 144 2-move scrambles
		- periods = 10, epochs = 50, batch size = 1


To-Do:
	- add batching
	- add cuda utilization
	- add MCTS using trained network
